Archive Statement:

As of March 2019, this repository is read-only as Salesforce has archived the Aura open-source UI framework. Aura components will continue to be supported, but the project is no longer open source.

Salesforce has introduced a new programming model for the Lightning Component Framework called [Lightning Web Components](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/projects/quick-start-lightning-web-components). This programming model is designed for building fast components using modern JavaScript and Web Standards. Lightning web components and Aura components can coexist and interoperate on a page.


* To learn more about Aura components, start with the [Aura Components Basics](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/lex_dev_lc_basics) module in Trailhead.
* For more details, see the [Lightning Aura Components Developer Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/).
