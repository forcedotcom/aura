<aura:component extends="auradocs:topicPanel">

    <aura:set attribute="title" value="What is Inherited?"/>

    <p>This topic lists what is inherited in Aura.</p>

    <h2>Component Attributes</h2>

    <p>All attributes are inherited. You can override an attribute in a sub-component using <code>&lt;aura:attribute&gt;</code>. However, you should only do this if you want to change the attribute's default value in the sub-component.</p>

    <p>Use <code>&lt;aura:set&gt;</code> in a sub-component to set an attribute on the parent component.</p>

    <h2>Events</h2>

    <p>A sub-component can handle component events fired by the super component. The super and sub-component can handle the same event in different ways. Aura doesn't guarantee the order of event handling.</p>

    <p>When an event fires, handlers for the event are executed. Handlers for any event that extend the event are also fired.</p>

    <h2>Helpers</h2>

    <p>A child component's helper inherits the methods from the helper of its super component. A child component can override a super component's helper method by defining a method with the same name as an inherited method.</p>

    <h2>What Isn't Inherited?</h2>

    <p>Neither controllers nor the model are inherited by a sub-component.</p>
