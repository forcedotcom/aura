        <li>Explore the capabilities of the Aura framework through the <auradocs:topicLink topic="buildApp">Aura Note sample app</auradocs:topicLink></li>
        <li>Browse <auradocs:navLink location="reference">components</auradocs:navLink> that come out-of-the-box with Aura</li>
        <li>Read <auradocs:topicLink topic="basics">The Basics</auradocs:topicLink> section to learn more about the fundamental building blocks of Aura</li>
