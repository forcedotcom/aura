    <p>An app is a special top-level component whose markup is in a .app file. Just like any other component, you can put CSS in the component bundle in a file called <code>&lt;appName&gt;.css</code>. For example, the demo app markup is in <code>notes.app</code>. Its CSS is in <code>notes.css</code>.</p>
