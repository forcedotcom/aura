<aura:component extends="auradocs:topicPanel">
    <aura:set attribute="title" value="Getting User Input" />
    <p>Aura provides out-of-the-box input components that enable you to easily retrieve and process user input with built-in features such as value binding and event handling. 
    These components provide a consistent experience across mobile and desktop devices, taking advantage of HTML5 functionalities and providing a fallback experience for older browsers.
    For an example on error handling on an input component, see <auradocs:topicLink topic="error">Error Handling</auradocs:topicLink>.
    </p>

    <h3><code>ui:input</code></h3>
    <p> <code>ui:input</code> is an abstract and extensible component that gets user input for processing. Child components that extends <code>ui:input</code>, such as <code>ui:inputText</code> and <code>ui:inputNumber</code>, inherit its attributes and events.
    The demo below shows commonly used <code>ui</code> components.</p>
