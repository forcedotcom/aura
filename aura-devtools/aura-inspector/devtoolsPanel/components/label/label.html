<!--
	Description:
	Output the localized version of a label. Wraps a chrome.i18n.getMessage() call.

	Usage:
	<aurainspector-label key="LABEL_KEY"></aurainspector-label>

	Notes:
	LABEL_KEY is defined in messages.json.

	If the LABEL_KEY does not exist in messages.json, you'll see [LABEL_KEY] instead.

	As convention, I've been doing AREA_term, so for event card its eventcard_parameters, for actions panel its actions_mylabel.
